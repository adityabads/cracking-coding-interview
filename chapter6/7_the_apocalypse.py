# The Apocalypse
# In the new post-apocalyptic world, the world queen is desperately concerned
# about the birth rate. Therefore, she decrees that all families should ensure
# that they have one girl or else they face massive fines. If all families
# abide by this policy â€” that is, they have continue to have children until
# they have one girl, at which point they immediately stop â€” what will the
# gender ratio of the new generation be? (Assume that the odds of someone
# having a boy or a girl on any given pregnancy is equal.) Solve this out
# logically and then write a computer simulation of it.

# See the corresponding `.md` file for the mathematical answer.

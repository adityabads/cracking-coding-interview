# Dominos

## Question

There is an 8x8 chessboard in which two diagonally opposite corners have been cut off. You are given 31 dominos, and a single domino can cover exactly two squares. Can you use the 31 dominos to cover the entire board? Prove your answer (by providing an example or showing why it's impossible).

## Answer

No. Opposite corner tiles are the same color. Without loss of generality, let the two tiles be black. Then there are 2 more white tiles in the chessboard than black tiles. But each domino covers one white tile and one black tile, so no matter how we arrange the dominos, we cannot cover remaining 2 white tiles.

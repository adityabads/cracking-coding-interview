# Jugs of Water

## Question

You have a five-quart jug, a three-quart jug, and an unlimited supply of water (but no measuring cups). How would you come up with exactly four quarts of water? Note that the jugs are oddly shaped, such that filling up exactly "half" of the jug would be impossible.

## Answer

Solution:
1. Fill the 5-quart jug to get 5 quarts.
2. Pour the contents of the 5-quart jug into the 3-quart jug until full the 3-quart jug is full (a total of 3 quarts). So there are 2 quarts remaining in the 5-quart jug.
3. Empty the 3-quart jug, and pour the contents of the 5-quart jug into the 3-quart jug. There are now 2 quarts in the 3-quart jug.
5. Fill the 5-quart jug to get 5 quarts.
5. Pour the contents of the 5-quart jug into the 3-quart jug until the 3-quart jug is full (a total of 1 quart). So there are now 4 quarts in the 5-quart jug.
